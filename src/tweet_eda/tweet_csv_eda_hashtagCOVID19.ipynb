    "The purpose of this notebook is to explore our scraped tweets with query of the hashtag \"#COVID19\". In this we are going to first preprocess the tweets, perform some visualisations and later on investigate if there is a correlation between COVID19 and scarcity and if so, try to quantify it. An issue with this very model is that we require a benchmark to compare against, otherwise the values we report are effectively useless. Maybe a better model would be to query the hashtag \"#Hunger\" or \"#Poverty\" and see how many associations there are with coronavirus. Again, past data would come in handly. Perhaps a Premium Twitter Developer account may help and we can form a partnership of some kind with the right people to aid in this quest for analysis of tweets. More visualiastion here than NLP.\n",

    "Some time later: Preprocessing took too long, reducing amount of lines to just 1000. Query hashtag \"#hunger\" and see how many are related to '#covid19'. See if we can apply BERT/ALBERT to predict if hashtag also contains #Covid also.\n",
